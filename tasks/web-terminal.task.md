# Task: Web Terminal MVP Implementation

## Overview
Implement a standalone web-based terminal application with secure authentication, real-time terminal access, and Docker deployment support.

## Subtasks

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Testing Framework
- [ ] 1-1 Initialize project structure and dependencies
- [ ] 1-2 Set up testing framework (Jest + Supertest)
- [ ] 1-3 Write core test suites for authentication
- [ ] 1-4 Write core test suites for terminal management
- [ ] 1-5 Implement health check endpoint with tests

### Phase 2: Authentication System
- [ ] 2-1 Implement JWT token generation and validation
- [ ] 2-2 Create user login API with rate limiting
- [ ] 2-3 Implement Socket.IO authentication middleware
- [ ] 2-4 Add session management (in-memory first)
- [ ] 2-5 Write and pass all authentication tests

### Phase 3: Terminal Core Functionality
- [ ] 3-1 Implement PTY process management with node-pty
- [ ] 3-2 Create WebSocket event handlers for terminal operations
- [ ] 3-3 Implement terminal input/output with backpressure management
- [ ] 3-4 Add terminal resize functionality
- [ ] 3-5 Implement session persistence and recovery

### Phase 4: Frontend Development
- [ ] 4-1 Create HTML structure with login form
- [ ] 4-2 Integrate xterm.js for terminal UI
- [ ] 4-3 Implement WebSocket client connection
- [ ] 4-4 Add terminal event handling (create, data, resize)
- [ ] 4-5 Implement basic theme support

### Phase 5: Security and Deployment
- [ ] 5-1 Configure Helmet with proper CSP policies
- [ ] 5-2 Implement path validation and sandboxing
- [ ] 5-3 Add input size and rate limiting
- [ ] 5-4 Create Docker configuration
- [ ] 5-5 Write deployment documentation

### Phase 6: Testing and Validation
- [ ] 6-1 Run and pass all unit tests
- [ ] 6-2 Perform integration testing
- [ ] 6-3 Conduct security testing (path traversal, XSS)
- [ ] 6-4 Test Docker deployment
- [ ] 6-5 Create user documentation

## Success Criteria
- All core tests pass (>90% coverage)
- User can login and access terminal
- No critical security vulnerabilities
- Docker deployment works
- Documentation is complete

## Timeline
- Total Duration: 5 days
- Day 1: Phase 1 (Setup and Testing)
- Day 2: Phase 2 (Authentication)
- Day 3: Phase 3 (Terminal Core)
- Day 4: Phase 4 (Frontend)
- Day 5: Phase 5-6 (Security, Deployment, Testing)

## Dependencies
- Node.js 18+
- Docker (for deployment)
- Redis (optional, for production)

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: WebSocket compatibility issues
  - **Mitigation**: Use Socket.IO with fallback options
- **Risk**: Security vulnerabilities
  - **Mitigation**: Follow OWASP best practices, use security tools
- **Risk**: Cross-platform terminal issues
  - **Mitigation**: Test on multiple platforms, focus on Linux/Mac first

## Notes
- Follow TDD approach: write tests first, then implementation
- Keep MVP scope minimal: single user, single terminal
- Avoid over-engineering: implement directly, optimize later
- Maintain compatibility: don't break existing telegram-ssh-terminal
